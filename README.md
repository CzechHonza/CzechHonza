# Hi there! I'm Honza 👋

I'm a programmer based in Cheb, Czech Republic. My main focus is on developing applications that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. I have experience working with various programming languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I'm always looking to improve my skills and knowledge, and currently, I'm diving deeper into machine learning and data science. I'm also exploring new frameworks and libraries to enhance my development toolskit.

## 🔭 Projects

Here are some of the projects that I'm working on:

- **Arduino Home Security**<br>
I'm currently doing an advanced system with valid PIR sensors and (soon) cameras, that you can preview on a web!<br>

- **New Unity Networking Solution**<br>
I'm also currently working on a new networking solution (like Photon) to Unity.<br>

- **Tomato(and)Gains**<br>
With bunch of my friends, I'm working on a site, that's completly (or not, just discover it 🐏) based around tomatos and how to make some money from it!
